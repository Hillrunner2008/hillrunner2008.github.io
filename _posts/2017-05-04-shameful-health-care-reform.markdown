It's disgusting watching the GOP celebrate the fact that they voted for a bill that will kill thousands of people. Playing politics with people's lives. Unbelievable. I don't care that this bill won't pass the Senate its current state; I care that these Republicans are tossing back bud lights after voting to destroy the lives of so many people.

What needs to be said to you people that you will start to take this seriously? This would literally kill thousands of people and that isn't an exaggeration. This bill will kick people with preexisting conditions in to a high risk pool. These pools are terribly underfunded and capped and there is a waiting list to be approved. People will die waiting for approval. They voted to strip mandatory coverage of Essential Health Benefits. They voted to kill people and are laughing at it. The same party that claims to be "Pro Life" just voted to remove care for pregnant women and newborn care. WWJD, right?

These awful human beings voted to massively cut Medicaid funding and implement a per-capita cap structure. Now School programs for children with disabilities will be severely cut. Adults on Medicaid that are home-bound and require skilled nursing or specialized therapies would now be left to rot and die alone or go bankrupt to try and live.

To really top it off, these cowards voted for this bill without knowing the estimates from the Congressional Budget Office because they know there would be no way to pass it after it comes back with a report proving how this is worse than their first repeal bill. This bill was opposed by every single Hospital, Doctor, Nurse and Medical association and not to mention the AARP opposed this bill too.

These are facts and if this doesn't piss you off and motivate you to fight then I don't know what will. These Republicans are vile human beings that don't deserve to represent anyone.

Now the Bill is on to the Senate and what they propose won't look as bad as the House's version but it will be bad. Please call your Senator and let them know this isn't okay.
