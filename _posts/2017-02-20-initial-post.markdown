What happened to Republicans? This is beyond infuriating. Time and time again they are putting party over Country with their votes. These Senators that confirmed Devos today are cowards and traitors. Let me explain how that is not hyperbole.

You are confirming people in to the cabinet that are extremely unqualified to hold that position. How is that putting America first and how is that going to make America great again? This is not a "They did it to our guy now we're doing it to theirs" stance by the Democrats. They are not voting "nay" on these confirmations because of previous politics. They are voting no because these are terrible nominations plain and simple. You know it too but you don't care. You only care that this is what your party leader wants so you go along. You don't care about the plea from your constituents on both sides. You only care that these nominations have donated to you. You don't care about The United States of America. You are cowards.

How do Republicans turn a blind eye to the fact the Trump lambasted Hilary for "pay to play" but he nominates a Billionaire with literally no experience in public education? How do Republicans eat up the "drain the swamp" rhetoric but not recognize these nominations are the spawn from that same swamp? (Goldman Sachs Executives, Big Oil Executives and CEO's?) What is with your cognitive dissonance? How does a party that values Religious freedoms and traditional family values vote for and Idolize a self proclaimed womanizer, philanderer, sexual deviant, racist.....on and on and on and on? Are you lying to yourselves as a coping mechanism? Do you stop reading the Bible when you get to the Book of Matthew? Parable of the Wise and Foolish Builders? Parable of the Good Samaritan? Anything?
I understand not all Republicans are like this and I'm sorry for lumping you together. I also know that no person is perfect and I do not claim to know all the answers but I do know what is morally right and what is morally wrong. Basing policy and legislation on the Ideology of a few billionaires is Morally wrong.
We need Representatives that will stand firm on sound, progressive policy and work with each other to get rid of backwards partisanship and get money out of politics.
I know I could be one of those Representatives.

Who here would be willing to help make that happen? Representatives do not always need to be Lawyers or Executives or even have experience in Politics. Why shouldn't I run for office?! Can I count on your vote and your help? After discussing it with my wife and getting her blessing I let the North Carolina Democratic Party know I am interested in running but I need your help and support to get my name out there!

Here are some of the things I would work towards:
 - I will work to bring sensible reform the Affordable Care Act. 
 - I will work on providing help for Small Businesses in the form of tax breaks, including: minimizing payroll tax on employers with less than 50 employees and creating a Small Business-Accelerated Depreciation Deduction. (If fortune 500's can do it, so can you) 
 - I will promote Tax reform on large Corporations, especially on the Effective Tax Rate . They are not paying their fair share.
 - I will work on providing more funding and services for Special Education and Special needs.
 - I will work on expanding Medicare and Medicaid. 
 - I will work towards providing equal rights for the LGBTQ community.
 - I will work on providing funding for early childhood education.
If you disagree with me in every way, feel free to let me know but please also tell me what is important to you.

I Love and appreciate every one of you.
